In the twenty-first century, the increase in popularity of quad copters and personal drones has permeated industries worldwide. These industries include filmmaking and photography, where high-resolution cameras fixed onto drones provide new angles and shots, opening many more visual possibilities. In agriculture, drones are used for spraying herbicides and pesticides, allowing for automation on the farm. Amazon, the famous worldwide shopping and delivery service, uses drones to deliver small packages in record time, only mere minutes. These innovations have driven mankind further into the technological age.  

Quad copters consist simply of a microcontroller and related real time hardware that powers and adjusts the RPM of four propellers to control the drone movement via thrust. Penn State Behrend’s Electrical and Computer Engineering department owns one such drone. It is a quad copter whose hardware is largely assembled and is missing the driving software. This senior design project implements multiple software solutions required to operate the drone. It will implement easy to use software and a low-latency control scheme to ensure a largely user-friendly experience for demonstration purposes. A user with no knowledge of the drone’s design should be able to pilot it with no difficulty.
